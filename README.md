# Idea
I have always curious of how payment API works. Introducing some sort of payment system into a web app
is always so complicated, and sometimes a small mistake can ruin a business's reputation and cause troubles.
I found this popular payment API called Stripe that provides a convenient way of paying, monitoring
customer's transaction, and product catalog. I made my own version of donut shop to show the overall process.
And feel free to purchase some donuts and put some fake bank information in the stripe payment page. You won't get charged since these are fake data! Don't worry.
